The Multiselect field plugin introduces a select field type for the panel that allows you to choose multiple entries.

The plugin is free, but I would appreciate it if you would support me with a [moral license](https://gumroad.com/l/kirby-multiselect)!


## Requirements
Since version 1.0.0 the multiselect field requires Kirby CMS 2.3 or higher.  
If you are running an older version of Kirby, please use [version 1.4.0](https://github.com/distantnative/multiselect/releases/tag/v1.4) of the multiselect field.


## Installation & Update
Copy the files to `site/plugins/field-multiselect/`.


## Usage

Use it in your blueprint:

```
bestband:
  label: Best Band Ever
  type: multiselect
  required: true
  search: true
  options:
    1d : 1Direction
    bb: BBoys
    aq: Aqua
    vb: Vengaboys
    fr: Freiheit
    o3: OH!O
    mi: Miley
    bi: Bieber
    u2: U2
```

Result:

![multiselect](https://nhoffmann.com/remote/github/field-multiselect/example.gif)  

It can also be used with the usual field options (pages etc.) of the [checkboxes field](https://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet/panel-fields/checkboxes).

## Use Case: Related Pages

A great use for the multiselect field are related pages/articles. Just set up e.g. your blog article blueprint as follows:

```
related:
  label: Related Articles
  type: multiselect
  search: true
  options: query
  query:
    fetch: siblings
    value: '{{id}}'
```

And then use them in your template:

```php
<?php foreach($page->related()->pages(',') as $related): ?>
  â€¦
<?php endforeach ?>
```
